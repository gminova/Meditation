# Meditation App

This is a react native application that displays a list songs that you can listen to.
 
The data for each song, which currently are just dummy data are stored in a Google spreadsheet and I use the [GraphQLSheet app](https://graphqlsheet.com/) to fetch them.

For handling the sound I use the `react-native-sound` npm package.

The navigation is done with the `react-navigation` and for the styling I use the `styled-components` package.
